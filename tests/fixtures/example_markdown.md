# Main Header

This is a normal paragraph. It will contain **some bold text**
and maybe some `inline code` tags.

* list item 1
* list item 2
* list item 3

1. ordered item 1
2. ordered item 2

Now, this paragraph will have a more complex markdown. It will contain:
![describe this image](images)
and maybe some **bold** text, some `code_snippets` and some *italics* even.
I might even add a [hyperlink](www.google.com) here and there, just to throw
some spice
